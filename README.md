# React Redux Setup

This repository provides a starter template for initializing a React.js project with Redux. It integrates popular libraries like Axios for HTTP requests, Formik for form management, and Redux for state management. This setup aims to help you quickly bootstrap a React project with the necessary configurations for handling global state, API requests, and routing.
